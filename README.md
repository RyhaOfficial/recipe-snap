## About The Project

Recipe Snap is designed to make recipe discovery and cooking assistance more intuitive and engaging. Simply snap a picture of a dish, and our AI, powered by Google's Gemini model through the Genkit framework, will attempt to generate a plausible recipe for you. You can also chat with our AI chef for any cooking-related queries, whether it's about a generated recipe or general cooking advice.

This project was initially developed by an AI model as a test of its capabilities and is now being actively maintained and improved by [RyhaOfficial](https://github.com/RyhaOfficial). We aim to create a helpful and fun tool for food enthusiasts of all levels.

## Features

Recipe Snap offers a range of features to enhance your cooking experience:

-   **üç≥ Image-to-Recipe Generation:** Upload a photo of a food item, and the application uses AI to analyze the image and generate a detailed recipe. This includes ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and sometimes even estimated cooking times.
-   **ü§ñ AI Chef Chat:** Engage in a conversation with an AI-powered chef. You can ask questions about specific recipes (including those generated from images), cooking techniques, ingredient substitutions, or any other culinary topic.
-   **üîë Secure API Key Management:** The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. Users can securely enter and store their API key locally in their browser. The key is only used for interacting with the Gemini API and is not stored on any server.
-   **üåê Multi-Language Support:** Select your preferred language for the application interface and for the content generated by the AI, making it accessible to a wider audience.
-   **üì± Fully Responsive Design:** Whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, Recipe Snap adapts to your screen size for a seamless user experience.
-   **üé® Modern & Interactive UI:** Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI, the application boasts a clean, modern, and highly interactive user interface that is both aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate.
-   **üìÑ Content Moderation:** Includes a flow for moderating image content to ensure appropriateness before processing.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js**: Latest LTS version recommended (e.g., v18.x or v20.x). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
-   **npm** or **yarn**: A package manager for Node.js. npm is included with Node.js. If you prefer yarn, you can install it from [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/).
-   **Git**: For cloning the repository. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RyhaOfficial/recipe-snap.git
    cd recipe-snap
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
    This will download all the packages listed in `package.json`.

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    The application requires a Google Gemini API key to interact with the AI model.
    a.  Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root directory of the project (i.e., alongside `package.json`).
    b.  Add your Google Gemini API key to this file in the following format:
        ```env
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
        Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key.
    c.  *Where to get an API key:* You can obtain a Gemini API key by visiting [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and creating a new API key.

    **Important:** The `.env.local` file is included in `.gitignore` by default, so your API key will not be committed to your Git repository.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    Once the installation and environment setup are complete, you can start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    This command starts the Next.js development server, typically using Turbopack for faster builds. The application will usually be available at `http://localhost:9002`. The terminal will display the exact address.

    You may also want to run the Genkit developer UI separately if you are working on the AI flows:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This typically starts on `http://localhost:4000`.

Now you should be able to open the application in your web browser and start exploring its features!

## Usage

Using Recipe Snap is straightforward:

1.  **Open the Application:** Navigate to `http://localhost:9002` (or the address provided by your development server) in your web browser.
2.  **Enter API Key:** If it's your first time or your API key isn't set, you'll be prompted by the "API Key Manager" section. Enter your Gemini API Key here. This key is stored locally in your browser's local storage and is required for the AI features to work.
3.  **Select Language (Optional):** Use the "Language Selector" to choose your preferred language for interacting with the app and for the AI-generated content.
4.  **Generate a Recipe from an Image:**
    *   In the "Recipe Generator" section, click the "Upload Image" or similar button.
    *   Select an image of a food dish from your device.
    *   The AI will process the image and display a generated recipe, including ingredients and instructions.
5.  **Chat with the AI Chef:**
    *   Go to the "Chat Interface" section.
    *   If you've generated a recipe, it might be pre-filled as context for the chat.
    *   Type your cooking-related questions into the chat input field and press Enter or click the send button.
    *   The AI chef will respond to your queries.

**Tips for Best Results:**

*   **Clear Images:** For image-to-recipe generation, use clear, well-lit photos of the dish where the main ingredients are visible.
*   **Specific Questions:** When chatting with the AI chef, ask specific questions for more helpful answers.

## Available Scripts

This project comes with several predefined npm scripts (see `package.json`) to help with development and maintenance:

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server using Turbopack, typically on port 9002. This script enables fast refresh and other development-friendly features.
-   `npm run build`: Compiles and optimizes the Next.js application for production. The output is stored in the `.next` directory.
-   `npm run start`: Starts the Next.js production server after a build has been completed. This is used to serve the optimized application.
-   `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint, a static code analysis tool, to identify and report on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, helping to maintain code quality and consistency.
-   `npm run typecheck`: Runs the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) with the `--noEmit` flag to perform a full type check of the project without generating JavaScript files. This helps catch type errors early.
-   `npm run genkit:dev`: Starts the Genkit development server using `tsx` to run `src/ai/dev.ts`. This is useful for testing and developing AI flows with Genkit.
-   `npm run genkit:watch`: Similar to `genkit:dev`, but it also watches for changes in `src/ai/dev.ts` and related files, automatically restarting the Genkit server when changes are detected.

## Deployment

While this project is primarily set up for local development, here are general guidelines for deploying a Next.js application:

1.  **Build the Application:**
    Run the build script to create an optimized production build:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will generate a `.next` folder containing the production assets.

2.  **Choose a Hosting Provider:**
    There are many platforms that support Next.js deployments, including:
    *   [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (Recommended, by the creators of Next.js)
    *   [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
    *   [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
    *   [Google Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)
    *   Self-hosting on a Node.js server.

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Ensure your hosting provider is configured with the necessary environment variables, especially `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Most platforms provide a way to set these securely.

4.  **Deploy:**
    Follow the specific instructions for your chosen hosting provider. For Vercel and Netlify, you can often connect your Git repository for automatic deployments on push.

    If self-hosting, you would typically run:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    Ensure your server environment is correctly set up to serve the Next.js application.

**Note on Genkit Flows:**
The AI flows managed by Genkit (`src/ai/flows/`) might require additional setup depending on the deployment environment if they are intended to run server-side independently of the Next.js app (e.g., as separate cloud functions). However, in the current setup, they are integrated within the Next.js application context. For scaling or more complex AI backend needs, consider deploying Genkit flows as separate services (e.g., Google Cloud Functions). Refer to the [Genkit documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/deploy) for advanced deployment patterns.
